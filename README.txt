Fine Print v0.55a

-- SUMMARY --

Fine Print is a mod that more than doubles the original number of contracts
within Kerbal Space Program v0.24.

New contract types include contracts to build space stations, contracts
to build planetary bases, contracts to retrieve asteroids, contracts 
to fly planes in atmospheric conditions, contracts to drive rovers 
around the surface of a planet searching for things, and contracts to
deploy purpose built satellites into very specific orbits.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

Kerbal Space Program version 0.24.2

-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as you normally install mods for Kerbal Space Program - by 
  extracting the folder in this archive into the GameData folder in Kerbal 
  Space Program's directory.

* If this is a new version, delete the older version before extracting.

-- INSTRUCTIONS --

* Contracts will not appear until you can actually finish them. A contract to 
  build a station will not appear until you have solar panels, and contracts to 
  drive rovers will not appear until you have wheels, so do not be alarmed if 
  you do not see anything new in a fresh game. They will appear as you research.

* The new contract types are taken by visiting Gene Kerman, much like the 
  original contracts. There is one difference, some of the contracts in Fine 
  Print utilize a new waypoint system that will show specific locations on the 
  map. Usually you want to visit these locations to complete the contract.

-- CUSTOMIZATION --

* Textures are found in the Textures folder, you can change them to change 
  the waypoint visuals on the map.

* Textures must be 16x16 and white on transparency to facilitate coloring 
  them on the map.

* In your GameData\Squad\Resources folder, you will find StoryDefs.cfg - 
  this file is used to generate flavor text at the top of mission briefings.
  Within it you will find keywords occasionally, look for the word "rescue" 
  for instance. If you would like to add your own flavor text for my contracts
  the keywords are: spacestation, groundbase, roversearch, surveyflight,
  asteroidretrieval, and deploysatellite.

-- TROUBLESHOOTING --

* If you notice any contracts behaving strangely, please check the debug log 
  by hitting Alt-F12 and reporting any messages that might look applicable to 
  the problem you are having on the official thread along with a detailed 
  description of exactly how it is behaving strangely for you.

* Do not hesitate to report bugs, feature suggestions, or balance change 
  suggestions. I will listen.

-- FAQ --

Q: What technologies do I need to have to get the new contracts?

A: Wheels, Probes, Wings, and for stations and bases some power generation, 
   docking ports, and antennae. Satellites also require power and antennae.

Q: I'm at a waypoint and it isn't registering my visit!

A: Make sure your wheels are on the ground on a rover mission, for planes make 
   sure that you are within the altitude window.

Q: How can I thank you?

A: Simply tell me "thanks" on the official thread. I enjoy seeing other people
   enjoy my work. There might be a donation link there some day if you must 
   thank with your coin. Oh and pressure Squad to hire me. I like Mexico.

Q: I am experiencing something crazy with your mod, where do I tell you?

A: On the official thread! http://tinyurl.com/fine-print-thread
